<div class='line'>time by any other era whereof there is record. The opening</div>
<div class='line'>proposition made by the Spirit of that Age, involved the rectification of the Old World's hereditary wrongs. In France to some</div>
<div class='line'>extent this was bloodily effected. But what then? Straightway the</div>
<div class='line'>Revolution itself became a wrongdoer, one more oppressive than</div>
<div class='line'>the kings. Under Napoleon it enthroned upstart kings, and initi-</div>
<div class='line'>ated that prolonged agony of continual war whose final throe was</div>
<div class='line'>Waterloo. During those years not the wisest could have foreseen</div>

<div class='line'>a common sailor, so intensely black that he must needs have been</div>
<div class='line'>a native African of the unadulterate blood of Ham. A sym-</div>

<div class='line'>the displayed ebony of his chest; in his ears were big hoops of</div>

<div class='line'>along, the center of a company of his shipmates. These were made</div>

<div class='line'>have well fitted them to be marched up by Anacharsis Cloots</div>

<div class='line'>character all but extinct now, but occasionally to be encountered,</div>

<div class='line'>the boats on the tempestuous Erie Canal or, more likely, vaporing</div>
<div class='line'>in the groggeries along the tow-path. Invariably a proficient in his</div>
<div class='line'>perilous calling, he was also more or less of a mighty boxer or</div>
<div class='line'>wrestler. It was strength and beauty. Tales of his prowess were</div>
<div class='line'>recited. Ashore he was the champion; afloat the spokesman; on</div>
<div class='line'>every suitable occasion always foremost. Close-reefing topsails</div>
<div class='line'>in a gale, there he was, astride the weather yard-arm-end, foot in</div>
<div class='line'>the Flemish horse as “stirrup,” both hands tugging at the “ear-</div>
<div class='line'>ring” as at a bridle, in very much the attitude of young Alexan-</div>

<div class='line'>to the strenuous file along the spar.</div>

<div class='line'>hended from the temper of the men; and it was thought that</div>

<div class='line'>species as a landsman is in some respects singularly distinct from</div>
<div class='line'>him. The sailor is frankness, the landsman is finesse. Life is</div>
<div class='line'>not a game with the sailor, demanding the long head; no intricate</div>

<div class='line'>equal terms—equal superficially, at least—soon teaches one that</div>
<div class='line'>unless upon occasion he exercises a distrust keen in proportion to</div>
<div class='line'>the fairness of the appearance, some foul turn may be served him.</div>
<div class='line'>A ruled undemonstrative distrustfulness is so habitual, not with</div>
<div class='line'>business-men so much, as with men who know their kind in less</div>
<div class='line'>shallow relations than business, namely certain men-of-the-</div>

<div class='line'>Claggart and what was really going on in him his feeling par-</div>

<div class='line'>clogged by strange dubieties. The perplexity he evinced pro-</div>
<div class='line'>ceeded less from aught touching the man informed against—as</div>
<div class='line'>Claggart doubtless opined—than from considerations how best to</div>
<div class='line'>act in regard to the informer. At first indeed he was naturally for</div>
<div class='line'>summoning that substantiation of his allegations which Clag-</div>

<div class='line'>matter at once getting abroad which in the present stage of it, he</div>
<div class='line'>thought, might undesirably affect the ship's company. If Claggart</div>

<div class='line'>The measure he determined upon involved a shifting of the</div>

<div class='line'>and fidelity his master had much confidence. The lad appeared.</div>
<div class='line'>“You know Budd the foretopman?”</div>

<div class='line'>“I do, Sir.”</div>
<div class='line'></div>
<div class='line'>“Go find him. It is his watch off. Manage to tell him out of ear-</div>

<div class='line'>again looking an earnest interrogation as to what it was that had</div>
<div class='line'>resulted in such a tragedy.</div>
<div class='line'></div>
<div class='line'>But Captain Vere was now again motionless standing ab-</div>
<div class='line'>sorbed in thought. But again starting, he vehemently exclaimed—</div>
<div class='line'>“Struck dead by an angel of God. Yet the angel must hang!<”></div>
<div class='line'></div>
<div class='line'>At these passionate interjections, mere incoherences to the</div>
<div class='line'>listener as yet unapprised of the antecedent events, the Surgeon</div>
<div class='line'>was profoundly discomfited. But now as recollecting himself, </div>
<div class='line'>Captain Vere in less harsh tone briefly related the circumstances</div>
<div class='line'>leading up to the event.</div>
<div class='line'></div>
<div class='line'>“But come; we must despatch” he added. “Help me to remove</div>
<div class='line'>him (meaning the body) to yonder compartment,” designating</div>
<div class='line'>one opposite that where the foretopman remained immured.</div>
<div class='line'>Anew disturbed by a request that as implying a desire for secrecy,</div>
<div class='line'>seemed unaccountably strange to him, there was nothing for the</div>
<div class='line'>subordinate to do but comply.</div>
<div class='line'></div>
<div class='line'>“Go now” said Captain Vere with something of his wonted man-</div>
<div class='line'>ner, “Go now. I shall presently call a drumhead court. Tell the</div>
<div class='line'>lieutenants what has happened, and tell Mr. Mordant,” meaning</div>
<div class='line'>the captain of marines, “and charge them to keep the matter to</div>
<div class='line'>themselves.”</div>

<div class='line'>Ay, there is a mystery; but to use a Scriptural phrase, it is ‘a mys-</div>
